## Projects & Technical Work

This page highlights a selection of projects that represent how I learn, build, and iterate.  
Most of these started as small ideas or course assignments and then grew into opportunities to deepen my skills in Java, web development, and system design.

Over time, I’ll link each project to a dedicated page or write-up and include direct GitHub links.

## Java Mini-Game Collection

**Tech:** Java, OOP, basic data structures  
**Type:** Small weekly projects / mini-games

A collection of tiny Java games built during to practice core concepts in a fun, applied way. Each mini-project focused on a specific idea:

- Game loops, input handling, and basic control flow
- Using classes and objects to separate game logic
- Simple scoring systems and win/lose conditions
- Clean, commented code written for readability

<!-- Replace # with the actual repo link when ready -->

## Portfolio Website (This Site)

**Tech:** Astro, TypeScript/JavaScript, Markdown, Tailwind CSS  
**Type:** Personal portfolio & content site

This portfolio is more than a static page—it’s a living space to present my work, experiments, and writing.

- Built with a modern static site framework (Astro) for speed and flexibility
- Uses Markdown for content so I can ship updates quickly
- Designed to be recruiter-friendly: clear navigation, focused sections, and readable layouts
- Configured for theming, SEO, and future expansion (projects, blog, case studies)

<!-- Replace # with the actual repo link when ready -->

## Martial Arts Progress & Curriculum Planning (Concept / In Progress)

**Tech:** JavaScript/TypeScript, web stack (planned), data modeling  
**Type:** Practical tool idea based on real teaching experience

Drawing from years of teaching martial arts, I’m working on tools to:

- Track student progress across belts, techniques, and attendance
- Make it easy to see “what’s next” for each student
- Provide instructors with a quick view of class readiness and focus areas

This project blends **real-world domain knowledge** (martial arts instruction) with **technical design**, and will eventually be documented as a full case study.

## Cloud & Dev / Ops Experiments

**Tech:** Cloud hosting, containers, tunneling, automation (various tools)  
**Type:** Personal infrastructure experiments

Alongside application-level projects, I’ve been experimenting with:

- Deploying applications and services on cloud providers
- Using containers and dashboards to manage services more efficiently
- Setting up domains and routing traffic through secure tunnels
- Treating infrastructure as another learning playground for systems thinking

These experiments help me understand not just how to build software, but how it runs, scales, and is accessed in the real world.

## What’s Coming Next

Over time, I plan to:

- Add more detailed write-ups for each project
- Link directly to GitHub repositories for deeper code review
- Include screenshots, diagrams, and tech breakdowns
- Highlight projects that connect leadership, teaching, and technology

If you’re reviewing this as a recruiter or collaborator and would like to see specific code samples or repos, feel free to reach out—I’m happy to point you to the most relevant work for your interests.
